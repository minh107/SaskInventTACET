Hi Everyone, I'll start to structure this more formally as we go.
This is for two main development thursts:
1. Python Audio Analysis Core
2. Python Audio Analysis GUI
3. Python <--> Arduino Command Bridge

## Python Audio Analysis Core
This is the part where we do a bunch of math to analyze audio
## Python Audio Analysis GUI
We use this piece to command the Core to figure out what kind of analysis we want to do
## Python <--> Arduino Command Bridge
Because eventually we want to control something physical
